One approach that can be followed in such an instance is to incorporate additional features or information into the training data for the deep neural network. For example, if the dermatologist has access to additional clinical data such as the presence of comedones (clogged pores) or the location of the acne on the face, this information can be included in the training data to help differentiate between acne and monkeypox.

Another approach is to use multiple layers in the neural network, with each layer focused on a specific aspect of the skin condition. For example, one layer could be trained to identify the presence of comedones, while another layer could be trained to identify the location of the skin condition on the face. This can help the neural network to make more accurate predictions based on multiple features, rather than relying on a single feature such as the overall appearance of the skin.

Additionally, it may be helpful to incorporate additional expert knowledge or domain-specific information into the training process. For example, if the dermatologist has a deep understanding of the characteristics that typically differentiate acne from monkeypox, this information can be incorporated into the neural network to help it make more accurate predictions.

Overall, the key is to incorporate as much relevant information as possible into the training process, in order to reduce the likelihood of confusion between acne and monkeypox in the predictions made by the deep neural network.
